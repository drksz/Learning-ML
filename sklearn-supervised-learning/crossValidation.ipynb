    "### CROSS VALIDATION\n",
    "Cross-validation (CV) is an iterative process in which each datapoint or cluster of data is given an equal chance at becoming both a training and testing point for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Cross Validation?\n",
    "Say you have created and fitted a linear regression model and decide to evaluate its $R^2$ metric. Such metrics are heavily dependent on how the data is split during the train and test-splitting. Due to the random nature of the splitting of data, that $R^2$ metric may not be representative of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. The solution to this is applying cross-validation which iteratively splits data into training and testing sets multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation works by splitting the data into **folds**. One such fold is designated as test data and the rest as training data. This process is done in an iteration known as a **split**. For each split, the training and testing folds are updated. This ensures that the model has a different set of training and testing folds for each split iteration. At each step, the metric of interest (such as $R^2$) is also calculated. That is, if there have been $n$ splits, then there will be $n$ metrics computed as well. From these values we can compute statistics (e.g. mean, median, confidence intervals, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "CV done with $k$ number of folds is called $k$-fold cross-validation. Also, note that **as $k$ increases**, CV becomes more **computationally expensive**.\n"
